\paragraph{}Collecting statistics data is essential for analyzing the run-time behaviour of a computing system. Knowing the precise usage and the scale of a software tool is very helpful for developers. This project gives insight into the contents of the published payloads (number of files, payload size, type of files published), as well as some meta-information (garbage collection statistics, deduplication information) in order to analyze the CVMFS server behaviour.
