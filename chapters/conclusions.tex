\section{A monitoring tool}

\paragraph{}
Gathering CVMFS statistics project created a monitoring tool for CernVM FS server tools by recording different metrics into a local SQLite file:
\begin{itemize}
  \item number of added/removed/changed files
  \item number of added/removed/changed directories
  \item number of added/removed bytes
  \item compressed data size added/removed
  \item number of duplicated objects added
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
It will be available in the CernVM-FS 2.6.0 release.

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
\item More metrics can be added to this project in order to make use of the already implemented gathering statistics system used to record current metrics.
\item A Grafana instance can be used to visualize the data in a more user friendly environment.
\item Further test should be made to measure the cost of counting the number of condemned bytes in the garbage collector process.
\end{itemize}
